    <h2>How to make the sheet pan tacos:"</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil or parchment paper and lightly coat with 1 tablespoon olive oil.</li>
        <li>Combine beef, onion, green chiles, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, and salt in a medium bowl and mix until well incorporated.</li>
        <li>Wrap tortillas in a damp paper towel and microwave just until softened, about 30 seconds. </li>
        <li>Spread about 3 tablespoons beef mixture over half of a tortilla in a very thin layer that reaches to the edges
              Spread about 1 tablespoon beans onto the other half. Sprinkle all over with about 2 tablespoons cheese.
               Fold tortilla in half to make a taco; place on prepared baking sheet.
             Repeat with remaining tortillas, meat and cheese. Brush tops of tacos with remaining oil.
        </li>
        <li>Bake tacos in the preheated oven, flipping halfway through, until lightly browned, toasted, and crisp around the edges, 30 to 35 minutes
            . Serve with desired toppings.
